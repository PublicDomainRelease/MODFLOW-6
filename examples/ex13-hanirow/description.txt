Simple steady state model using a regular MODFLOW grid to simulate the response of an anisotropic confined aquifer to a pumping well. A constant-head boundary condition surrounds the active domain.  K22 is set to 0.01, which causes K in column direction to be 100 x less than K in the row direction.  Drawdown is more pronounced in row direction.
