This is the one-dimensional MODFLOW 6 extensometer model based on the model developed by Sneed (2008) to simulate aquitard drainage, compaction and, land subsidence at the Holly site, located at the Edwards Air Force base, in response to effective stress changes caused by groundwater pumpage in the Antelope Valley in southern California. This problem is described in the MODFLOW 6 CSUB Package Example Problems document released with MODFLOW 6 (version 6.1.0 or higher). The model simulates compaction in a combination of no-delay and delay interbeds and the default effective-stress formulation is used to simulate interbed compaction.
