This is the one-dimensional compaction in a three-dimensional flow field problem that is described in the MODFLOW 6 CSUB Package Example Problems document released with MODFLOW 6 (version 6.1.0 or higher). This problem is based on the problem presented in the SUB-WT package for MODFLOW-2005 report (Leake and Galloway, 2007) and represents groundwater development in a hypothetical aquifer that includes some features typical of basin-fill aquifers in an arid or semi-arid environment. The problem of Leake and Galloway (2007) was modified to include compaction of coarse-grained aquifer materials and water compressibility. The model simulates compaction in no-delay interbeds and the default effective-stress formulation is used to simulate interbed compaction.
