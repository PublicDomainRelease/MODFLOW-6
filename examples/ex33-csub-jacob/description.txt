This is the Jacob (1939) train problem simulates elastic compaction of aquifer materials in response to the loading of an aquifer by
a passing train. The problem is described in the MODFLOW 6 CSUB Package Example Problems document released with MODFLOW 6 (version 6.1.0 or higher). This problem demonstrates elastic compaction of coarse-grained aquifer materials and time-varying loading at the surface to simulate the train passing an observation well in MODFLOW 6. The default effective-stress formulation is used to simulate coarse-grained material compaction.
