This is the Problem 1 from the Subsidence Package for MODFLOW-2000 documentation (Hoffman and others, 2003), which is described in the MODFLOW 6 CSUB Package Example Problems document released with MODFLOW 6 (version 6.1.0 or higher).  This simulates the drainage of a thick interbed caused by a step decrease in hydraulic head in the aquifer in MODFLOW 6. The thick interbed is simulated using a delay-bed interbed and the default effective-stress formulation is used to simulate thick interbed compaction.
