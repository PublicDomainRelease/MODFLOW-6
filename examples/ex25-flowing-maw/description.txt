This is a multi-aquifer well simulation that demonstrates how to implement the flowing well option available in Multi-Aquifer Well (MAW) Package in MODFLOW 6. Aquifer properties and initial heads are identical to Neville and Tonkin (2004).  The pumping rate for well in the center of the domain is 0.0 cubic meters per day and the flowing well discharge elevation and conductance are specified to be 0.0 meters and 7,500 square meters per day.
